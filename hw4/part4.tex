\begin{problem}
Little Red Riding Hood is assembling a fruit basket for her sick grandmother.
The basket will contain 26 fruit, including
apples, bananas, mangos and strawberries (and no other fruit). 
The basket must contain
%
\begin{itemize}
	\item at least $6$ apples, 
	\item at least $4$ bananas, 
	\item at least $5$ mangos, and
	\item at least $3$ and not more than $5$ strawberries. 
\end{itemize}
%
Determine the number of ways to assemble the fruit basked.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
let x be apples, y bananas, z mangos, t strawberries.

$$x+y+z+t=26$$
$$0\le x \le 6$$
$$0\le y \le 4$$
$$0\le z \le 5$$
$$3\le t \le 5$$

We want strawberries to to have a 0 on the lhs of its inequality. we sub $t'=t-3$ which results in $0 \le t' \le 2$ and readjusts the eqn to

$$x+y+z+t' = 23$$

we know $S(x \le 6 \land y \le 4 \land z \le 5 \land t' \le 2) = S - S(x \ge 7 \lor y \ge 5 \lor z \ge 6 \lor t' \ge 3)$. We'll refer to LHS as Q from now on.

Where S is the entire set without constraints.

Solving for S using ${m + k - 1} \choose {k - 1}$:

$$S = {26 \choose 3} = 2600$$
\begin{multline*}
Q = S - ( {19 \choose 3} + {21 \choose 3} + {20 \choose 3} + {23 \choose 3} - {14 \choose 3} - {13 \choose 3}\\
 - {16 \choose 3} - {15 \choose 3} - {18 \choose 3} - {17 \choose 3} + {8 \choose 3} + {11 \choose 3} + {10 \choose 3} + {12 \choose 3} - {5 \choose 3} )\\
 = 2600 - 2100
 = 500
\end{multline*}

\end{solution}
