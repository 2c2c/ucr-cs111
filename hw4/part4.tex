\begin{problem}
Little Red Riding Hood is assembling a fruit basket for her sick grandmother.
The basket will contain 26 fruit, including
apples, bananas, mangos and strawberries (and no other fruit). 
The basket must contain
%
\begin{itemize}
	\item at least $6$ apples, 
	\item at least $4$ bananas, 
	\item at least $5$ mangos, and
	\item at least $3$ and not more than $5$ strawberries. 
\end{itemize}
%
Determine the number of ways to assemble the fruit basked.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
let x be apples, y bananas, z mangos, t strawberries.

$$x+y+z+t=26$$
$$6\le x$$
$$4\le y$$
$$5\le z$$
$$3\le t \le 5$$

We want all fruits to have a 0 on the lhs of its inequality. e.g. for t,  we sub $t'=t-3$ which results in $0 \le t' \le 2$.

\begin{align*}
x' = x-6, &&  0\le x' \\
y' = y-4, &&  0\le y' \\
z' = z-5, &&  0\le z' \\
x'+y'+z'+t' = 8 
\end{align*}
we know $S(x' \ge 0 \land y' \ge 0 \land z' \ge 0 \land t' \le 2) = S - S(t' \ge 3)$ (x,y,z cannot be negative, so they can be excluded). We'll refer to LHS as Q from now on.

Where S is the entire set without constraints.

Solving for S using ${m + k - 1} \choose {k - 1}$:

\begin{align*}
S &= {11 \choose 3} = 165 \\
Q &= S - {8 \choose 3}\\
  &= 165 - 56 \\
  &= 109
\end{align*}

\end{solution}
