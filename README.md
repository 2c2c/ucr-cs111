cs111 hw
========

goal is to split the problems into individual files and have a Makefile cat them up and run the latex render. that way if we work on separate questions there wont be merge conflicts.

the files are separated by the lone `%%%%%` comments in the file. as a result, q1 in hw1 is actually in part2.tex, q2 in part3.tex, etc. because the intro and end have `%%%%%` comments as well.
