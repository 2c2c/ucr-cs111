\begin{problem}
Let $n = p_1p_2...p_k$ where $p_1,p_2,...,p_k$ are different primes.	
Prove that $n$ has exactly $2^k$ different divisors. Give a complete argument.

For example, if $n =105$ then $n = 3\cdot 5 \cdot 7$, so $k=3$ and
thus $n$ has $2^3 = 8$ divisors. These divisors are $1,3,5,7,15,21,35,105$.

\emph{Hint:} You can reduce the problem to counting other objects, that we already
know how to count. Alternatively, this can be proved by induction on $k$.
