\begin{problem}
(a) Let $G = (V,E)$ be a graph with $|V| = n$, and let $k$ be an integer, where $1\le k\le n$.
Prove the following theorem:
``Suppose the the vertices in $V$ can be ordered $v_1,v_2,...,v_n$ in such a way
that each vertex $v_i$ has at most $k$ neighbors among the preceding
vertices $v_1,...,v_{i-1}$. Then $G$ can be colored with at most $k+1$ colors.''

For example, the figure below shows a graph and an ordering of its
vertices where each vertex has at most $3$ neighbors that precede it in this
ordering. So this theorem claims that this graph can be colored with $4$ colors.

\noindent
(b)
Prove that the theorem in part (a) above implies the following
statement: ``If all vertices of a graph $G$ have degree at most $D$
then $G$ can be colored with at most $D+1$ colors''.
(You will cover a different proof of this theorem in the discussion. Here you
only need to show how it can be derived from part (a).)

\begin{problem}
	You are given two bipartite graphs $G$ and $H$ below. For each
	graph determine whether it has a perfect matching.
	Justify your answer, either by 
	listing the edges that are in the matching or using
	Hall's Theorem to show that the graph does not have a
	perfect matching.

\begin{problem}
Determine which of the following two graphs are planar.
Justify your answer. (You need to either show a planar embedding or
use Kuratowski's theorem.)

\paragraph{Submission.}
To submit the homework, you need to upload the pdf file into ilearn by 8AM on Tuesday, June 3,
and turn-in a paper copy in class.
Pictures should be 
imported into {\LaTeX} in pdf (see the source file to see
how to do that). You can draw them in any drawing
software and export in pdf, or draw by hand and scan.
