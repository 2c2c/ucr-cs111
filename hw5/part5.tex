\paragraph{Submission.}
To submit the homework, you need to upload the pdf file into ilearn by 8AM on Tuesday, June 3,
and turn-in a paper copy in class.
Pictures should be 
imported into {\LaTeX} in pdf (see the source file to see
how to do that). You can draw them in any drawing
software and export in pdf, or draw by hand and scan.
