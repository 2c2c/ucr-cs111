\begin{problem}
Determine which of the following two graphs are planar.
Justify your answer. (You need to either show a planar embedding or
use Kuratowski's theorem.)

	\end{center}

\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
Graph $G$ can be shown to be nonplanar by merging $a\to f$ and $c\to e$.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{amergef.png} \\
  \includegraphics{cmergee.png}
  \end{center}

The above is the complete graph $K_5$. By Kuratowski's theorem, $G$ containing $K_5$ shows that it is nonplanar.

Graph $H$ can be shown to be planar with rearrangement.
