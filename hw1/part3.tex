\begin{problem}
Use mathematical induction to prove that $3^n \ge n2^n$ for $n\ge 0$. 
(Note: dealing with the base case may require some thought.)
\end{problem}

\begin{flushleft}
Base case:

First let's check P(2)/n=2.

$3^2 \ge 2\cdot2^2$
$9 \ge 8$

Which is always true.

\vskip 0.1in
Inductive step:

Let's assume P(k) / n=k (where $k$ is also $\ge 2$) and is true.

$3^k \ge k2^k$

Then P(k+1) / n=k+1

$3^{k+1} \ge (k+1)2^{k+1}$ \\
$3\cdot3^k \ge \ldots $  \\
$3\cdot k 2^k \ge \ldots $ rewriting LHS in terms of assumption \\
$3k \ge (k+1)2$ divided $2^k$ \\
$k \ge 2$ distribute and subtract $2k$ \\
Which is always true.

\vskip 0.1in
Last cases:

We have n=0 and n=1 left to check in order to satisfy all solutions n $\ge$ 0.

Let $n=0$.

$3^0 \ge 0\cdot2^0$\\
$1 \ge 0$\\

Which is always true.

Let $n=1$.\\
$3^1 \ge 1\cdot2^1$\\
$3 \ge 2$\\
Which is always true.\\

\vskip 0.1in
$\therefore$ P holds in all cases.
