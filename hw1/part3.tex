\begin{problem}
Use mathematical induction to prove that $3^n \ge n2^n$ for $n\ge 0$. 
(Note: dealing with the base case may require some thought.)
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
Base case:

First let's check P(2)/n=2.

\begin{gather*}
3^2 \ge 2\cdot2^2 \\
9 \ge 8
\end{gather*}

Which is always true.

\medskip
Inductive step:

Let's assume P(k) / n=k (where $k$ is also $\ge 2$) and is true.

$$3^k \ge k2^k$$

Then P(k+1) / n=k+1

\begin{align*}
3^{k+1} &\ge (k+1)2^{k+1} \\
3\cdot3^k &\ge \ldots   \\
3\cdot k 2^k &\ge \ldots \\
3k &\ge (k+1)2 \\
3k &\ge 2k + 2 \\
k &\ge 2 \\
\end{align*}

Which is always true.

\medskip
Last cases:

We have n=0 and n=1 left to check in order to satisfy all solutions n $\ge$ 0.

Let $n=0$.

\begin{gather*}
3^0 \ge 0\cdot2^0\\
1 \ge 0\\
\end{gather*}

Which is always true.

Let $n=1$.

\begin{gather*}
3^1 \ge 1\cdot2^1\\
3 \ge 2\\
\end{gather*}

Which is always true.

\medskip
Hence, P holds in all cases.

\end{solution}
