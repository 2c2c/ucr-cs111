\begin{problem}
(a)
Give the exact formula (as a function of $n$) for the number of
times ``bingo" is printed by Algorithm~\textsc{BingoPrint} below.
First express it as a summation formula and justify it. Then simplify it to 
obtain a closed-form expression. Show your derivation.

\noindent
(b)
Give the asymptotic value of the
number of ``bingo"s using the $\Theta$-notation. Include a brief justification. You will need a formula
for the sum of consecutive squares that you can find on the internet.

\begin{tabbing}
aa \= aa \= aa \= aa \= aa \= aa \= \kill
\textbf{Algorithm} \textsc{BingoPrint} $(n: \mbox{\bf integer})$ \\
      \> \textbf{for} $i \leftarrow 1$ \textbf{to} $2n+1$
                         \textbf{do} \\
      \> \> \textbf{for} $j \leftarrow 1$ \textbf{to} $i^2+2i$ \textbf{do} \\
      \> \> \> print(``bingo")
\end{tabbing}
\end{problem}
